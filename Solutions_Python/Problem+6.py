# ## Problem 6
# 
# ### The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
# ### 12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
# 
# ### The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
# ### (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
# 
# ### Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
# 
# ### Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
